Similar to the RDPIO, I would like to simplify integration with IO.

One thing I do NOT want is a lot of calls to `getUTCTime` every time an IO action is taken. Obtaining the current time is expensive, and multiple calls would return inconsistent values. So I should probably support IO integration where the current `logical` time is provided to the IO operation as a parameter.

I would still like to have a consistent local view, per instant. 

Sirea will likely benefit from a similar vat-like structure as what I used in RDPIO. A difference is that I will not expose this structure to clients of the library, and I will not make nearly as many efforts at cross-vat `snapshot` consistency or implicit batching. Such interactions will be more opaque due to the IO integration.
